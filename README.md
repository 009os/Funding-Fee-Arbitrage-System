# Funding Fee Arbitrage System

A TypeScript-based framework designed to automate and optimize funding fee arbitrage strategies in cryptocurrency markets.

> **Note:**  
> This repository contains only the basic infrastructure and logic flow of the project. The full implementation is not publicly available, as this was originally a private project. Sensitive or proprietary components, production logic, and detailed strategies are **not** included.

## Overview

Funding fee arbitrage is a trading strategy that seeks to profit from the differences in funding rates between different perpetual futures contracts, often across multiple exchanges. This system aims to streamline the process by providing reliable tools for monitoring, executing, and managing arbitrage trades.

## Features

- **Automated Monitoring:** Continuously tracks funding rates across supported exchanges.
- **Trade Execution:** Places and manages orders to exploit funding fee inefficiencies.
- **Risk Management:** Tools for position sizing, exposure limits, and stop-loss mechanisms.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Easily add support for new exchanges or custom strategies.
- **TypeScript Codebase:** Ensures type safety, maintainability, and scalability.
